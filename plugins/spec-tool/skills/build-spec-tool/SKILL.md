# /build-spec-tool

Bootstrap any monorepo with spec-driven development infrastructure. Creates `.ai-dev/` knowledge files (ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY.md, LEGAL.md, PLAN.md) that serve as a knowledge base for AI agents to generate implementation plans and validate against standards.

## What This Creates

```

## Workflow (5 Phases)

### Phase 1: Discovery (parallel)

Perform comprehensive codebase analysis with parallel exploration tasks:

**Codebase exploration** -- Analyze three key areas:
1. **Tech stack**: languages, frameworks, build systems, CI/CD patterns. Look at package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt, Makefile, Dockerfile, .github/workflows/
2. **Architecture**: services/apps, databases, message queues, API patterns. Look at docker-compose, k8s manifests, terraform, service definitions
3. **Conventions**: testing patterns, linting config, PR templates, CODEOWNERS, existing dev docs (*_dev.md, *_usage.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)

**User document ingestion** -- Ask the user to provide existing documentation:
- Existing architecture docs, ADRs, design docs
- Security policies, data classification rules
- Legal/compliance requirements, DPAs
- API conventions, coding standards

Offer three options:
- "Yes, I'll paste/provide paths" → collect and read them
- "No, let's build from scratch" → proceed to interview
- "Some -- let me share what I have" → collect partial, fill gaps in interview

### Phase 2: Optional Interview (3-5 rounds)

Ask if the user wants to be interviewed to fill gaps. If yes, conduct focused rounds:

1. **Architecture**: Language choices and why, database selection criteria, service communication patterns, deployment model (k8s, serverless, VMs)
2. **Data & Multi-tenancy**: How tenants are identified, data residency requirements, retention policies
3. **Security**: Data classification tiers, auth patterns (SSO, JWT, mTLS), secrets management, encryption requirements
4. **Legal/Compliance**: Regulated industries (healthcare, finance, education), AI/ML data restrictions, third-party DPA requirements
5. **Process**: PR review expectations, testing requirements (coverage, mocking policy), deployment/rollout patterns, feature flag strategy

Each round: show 5-10 bullet points of drafted content, get feedback, iterate.

### Phase 3: Generate Core Files

Read the reference templates from this skill's `references/` directory, then generate each file customized for the target repo:

1. **`.ai-dev/ARCHITECTURE.md`** -- Read `references/architecture_template.md` for structure. Fill in with the repo's actual tech stack, database choices, API patterns, testing conventions, and observability setup discovered in Phase 1-2.

2. **`.ai-dev/SECURITY.md`** -- Read `references/security_template.md` for structure. Fill in with the org's data classification rules, access control patterns, encryption requirements, and AI/ML policies.

3. **`.ai-dev/LEGAL.md`** -- Read `references/legal_template.md` for structure. Fill in with compliance frameworks, data residency rules, retention policies, and third-party service requirements.

4. **`.ai-dev/PLAN.md`** -- Copy from `references/plan_template.md`. Customize the Verification sections with the repo's actual test/lint/build commands discovered in Phase 1.

5. **`.ai-dev/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`** -- Copy from `references/system_prompt.md`. Customize:
   - Replace references to documentation index files with the repo's actual doc discovery patterns
   - Update ticket/issue tracker references to match the repo's tooling (GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira, etc.)

6. **Create `.agents/` directory** -- This directory stores agent definitions that can be used by any AI platform:
   - Copy `references/plan-review-agent.md` as the initial agent
   - Update `README.md` in the target repo with references to `.ai-dev/` knowledge files

### Phase 4: Platform Integration Guidance

Provide the user with platform-specific guidance on how to use the generated `.ai-dev/` files:
- Claude: Can be loaded directly as system context or skill knowledge
- GPT: Can be provided as system prompt or in conversational context
- Copilot: Can be integrated as project context or agent instructions
- Other AI platforms: See the `.ai-dev/` files as a knowledge base for any agent system

### Phase 5: Create Plan Review Agent

1. Read `references/plan-review-agent.md` from this skill
2. Create `.agents/plan-review-agent.md` in the target repo
3. No customization needed -- the agent reads `.ai-dev/` files dynamically to validate plans

## After Bootstrap

Present the user with a summary of what was created and next steps:

```
Spec-driven development infrastructure is set up. Here's what was created:

.ai-dev/ARCHITECTURE.md       -- Tech stack, architecture patterns, conventions
.ai-dev/SECURITY.md          -- Data classification, access controls, encryption
.ai-dev/LEGAL.md             -- Data residency, retention, compliance requirements
.ai-dev/PLAN.md              -- Spec template for implementation plans
.ai-dev/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md     -- Planning methodology and research guidelines
.agents/plan-review-agent.md -- Validates plans against standards
README.md                    -- Updated with .ai-dev/ references

Next steps:
1. Review each .ai-dev/ file and refine as needed
2. Commit the .ai-dev/ directory and .agents/ directory to your repo
3. Use with your AI agent:
   - Load .ai-dev/ files as context for planning sessions
   - Use plan-review-agent.md to validate generated plans
   - Refer to README.md for guidance on using spec-driven development
```

## Critical: No Guessed or Assumed Content

When filling in ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY.md, and LEGAL.md, **only include content that is directly sourced from**:

1. **Codebase evidence** -- patterns, tools, and conventions actually found by Explore agents in the repo
2. **User-provided documentation** -- docs, policies, or text the user explicitly provided or pointed to
3. **User interview answers** -- statements the user made during the interview rounds

**Never**:
- Guess at security policies, compliance frameworks, or legal requirements the user hasn't stated
- Assume database choices, auth patterns, or infrastructure details not found in the codebase
- Fill sections with generic best-practice content that wasn't sourced from the user or repo
- Infer organizational policies from the tech stack (e.g., don't assume "GDPR compliance" because there's an EU region)

If a section in the template can't be filled because the user hasn't provided the information and it wasn't discovered in the codebase, **leave the template placeholder brackets intact** with a note like `[Not yet documented -- fill in your org's policy here]`. An empty section with honest placeholders is better than a section with fabricated content that the user then trusts as ground truth.

The `.ai-dev/` files become the source of truth for all future planning. Inaccurate content here propagates into every plan the system generates.

## Other Important Notes

- **Never overwrite existing files** without asking. If `.ai-dev/ARCHITECTURE.md` already exists, show a diff and ask if they want to merge or replace.
- **The PLAN.md template is mostly universal** -- the main customization is the Verification section commands.
- **SYSTEM_PROMPT.md customization is light** -- mainly updating documentation discovery patterns and issue tracker references.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md requires the most work** -- it should reflect the repo's actual patterns, not generic advice.
- **All reference files are in this skill's `references/` directory** -- read them before generating.
- **Platform-agnostic by design** -- The generated `.ai-dev/` files are platform-agnostic and work with any AI agent system (Claude, GPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.)
